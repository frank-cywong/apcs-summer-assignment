1) No, I wug.\nYou wugga wug.\nI wug.\n
2) main() -> "No, I " -> zoop() -> baffle() -> "wug" -> ping() -> ".\n" -> zoop() Line 2 -> "You wugga " -> baffle() -> "wug" -> ping -> ".\n" -> main() Line 3 -> "I " -> baffle() -> "wug" -> ".\n"
3) It would end up in an infinite loop, constantly outputting "wug.\n".
